Build a REST API App for managing products for an e-commerce company.
The system should expose api endpoints in example.com/api/v1/products.
I want to perform add product, list products, get product details, update product, delete product (soft delete)

Tech Stack: Python 3.12, FastAPI, UV package manager, Mongodb, Pytest, playwright,
Ensure the project has swagger docs.

all your implementations should be documented in implementations folder in root level

## Data to be saved in DB

# name, description, category, price, stock, deletedAt

keep .env for any env variables, i prefer to use it for my mongodb.

If you want any other things to be clarified ask me now, before doing anything.
